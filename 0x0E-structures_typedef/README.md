0x0E. C - Structures, typedef
Structures are a collection of variables related in nature, but not necessarily in data type.
Structures are most commonly used to define an object—a person, a place, a thing—or similarly a record in a database or file.
The typedef keyword is used for creating structure definitions to build an alias relationship
with the structure tag (structure name).
